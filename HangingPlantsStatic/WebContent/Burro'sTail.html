                <li>The image displayed is indicative.</li>
                <li>Actual products may vary in shape or design as per the availability.</li>
                <li>The number of leaves and the size of the plant depends on seasonal availability.</li>
                <li>Since flowers are seasonal, flowering plants might be delivered without them. Flowers, if present in the plant, maybe in the fully bloomed, semi-bloomed, or bud stage.</li>
                <li>Since this product is shipped using the services of our courier partners, the date of delivery is an estimate.</li>
                <li>A courier product is delivered separately from other hand-delivered products.</li>
                <li>No deliveries are made on Sundays and National Holidays.</li>
                <li>Our courier partners do not call before delivering an order, so we recommend that you provide an address at which someone will be present to receive the package.</li>
                <li>The delivery cannot be redirected to any other address.</li>
                <li>All courier orders are carefully packed and shipped from our warehouse.</li>
                <li>As this is a real plant, the plant's height, and colors might vary slightly.</li>
                <li>There are certain risks associated with live shipping plants.</li>
                <li>While we take all precautions to ensure the plants arrive in good condition, some transit shock is normal.</li>
                <li>The selected delivery date is an estimate that relies on the product's availability and the location to which you want it shipped.</li>
                <li>You will get a tracking number soon after the order has been dispatched so that you can follow the gift delivery.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Care Instructions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep plants in medium-light locations, out of direct sunlight.</li>
                <li>Natural light is best, but some plants can also thrive in office fluorescent light.</li>
                <li>Plant soil should be kept moist at all times.</li>
                <li>Be careful to avoid overwatering.</li>
                <li>Do not allow plants to stand in water.</li>
